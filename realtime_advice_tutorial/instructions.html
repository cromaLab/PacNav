<div style="color:yellow; background-color:blue; border-style: solid; border-color:blue;"><b>Important:</b> Although the tutorial gives multiple chance of viewing the video. But in the actual task, the video ONLY plays once. Also there is ONLY 1 wrong move.</div>

<center><h2>Instructions</h2></center>
You will watch a PacMan game and your task is to identify the time in seconds when PacMan makes a wrong move, and suggest what the correct move is. When selecting a wrong move, consider the 3 PacMan Rules as well as the efficiency and accuracy of PacMan. Below is a frame-by-frame sequence in a video that demonstrates when you should suggest an incorrect move.<br />

<center><h2>3 PacMan Rules</h2></center>
<br />

3. PacMan can eat one of the 4 power pills and in doing so makes the Ghosts edible. (<b>TRICK:</b> To earn more points, an <b>edible Ghost is worth 200 points</b>, while a <b>pill is only worth 10 points</b>.)<br /><br />
